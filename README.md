# Blockchain-Intro

This repository contains the code that I used to understand blockchain system. It's a decentraliszed cryptocurrency that is based on "proof of work". You can mine, transfer and view the list of coins. Can be run on multiple hosts at the same time due to conflict resolution.

The requirements can be installed via:
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Some details can be tweaked in the `config.py` file.
